## Notes for Jonathan

The first lab is just getting the VMs set up.
- Put it as a lab to allow for you to run it as an activity
- I've added the Protech documentation for VMs 

The second lab is a case study.
- I really couldn't think of a programming lab to do for this first section, so I went to the old fallback of looking at an "OMG!" case study
- If you have a favourite alternative, feel free to substitute
- I also felt making the first operational lab a group exercise could be used as a kickoff.

I have tried to give a sense of the emergence of SE being driven by specific needs.
- When I teach this sort of thing I draw on my actual experiences with it so it's not just academic
- Feel free to add or alter based on your own similar experiences 

The part on process types is where I try to clarify what the difference is between Agile and others. 
- The adaptive/predictive model seems to work well since iterative methods are not just software based but even in software predate Agile
- I find that a lot of students have a rather incomplete idea of what Agile is and what it does.
- The DevOps and CICD are introduced in a later week in more detail but introduced here to also clarify distinctions.

I added the Sommerville text for you, but I'm not sure that we can distribute it freely. 
- Sommerville is retired and a lot of his material is freely available, including older editions of his book.
- Just playing it safe in terms of IP
