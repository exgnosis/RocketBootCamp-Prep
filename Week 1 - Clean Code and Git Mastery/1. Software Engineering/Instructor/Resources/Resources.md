## Sommerville

One of the standard books on software engineering is Sommerville. 
- Sommerville is retired now so I do see a note of his about making his material accessible but no details
- I have included a copy of his book in this folder.
- I am not sure about issus about distributing it; however it is available on a number of academic readings sites. I'll link those here if you want to use it in class
