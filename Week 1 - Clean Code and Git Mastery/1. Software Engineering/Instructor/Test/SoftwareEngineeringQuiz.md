1 Which statement best distinguishes programming from software engineering?
1. Programming focuses on application design, while software engineering focuses on the performance of the code on physical hardware.
2. _**Programming is writing and designing code using a programming language; software engineering uses engineering principles independent of any specific programming language**_ 
3. Programming involves unit testing the code as it is developed; software engineering defers testing until the application is fully ready to be deployed
4. Programming is for business facing systems; software engineering is for code that will run in high-performance embedded systems.
