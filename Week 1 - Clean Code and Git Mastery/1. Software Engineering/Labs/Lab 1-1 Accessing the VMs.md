# Lab 1-1: Accessing VNs

## Introduction

For the next four weeks, you will be using a Linux VM provided to you.

In this initial lab the Instructor will:
- Demonstrate and walk you through the process of signing on to you assigned VM.
- Do a tour of the applications loaded onto the machine
- Walk through a few simple tasks to get you familiar with the VM environment

There is some documentation on using the VM and the applications in the resources folder.
