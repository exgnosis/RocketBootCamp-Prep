# Lab 1-2: Case Study

## Objectives

To illustrate some of the software engineering concepts, you will examine a famous failure of the Denver Airport Luggage System.

You will work in groups to do the following
- Study the relevant documents
- Identify the factors that caused the failure
- Lay out a high-level plan of how you would have done the project to maximize its probability of success
- Justify your choices


## DIA Baggage System Failure

#### Background
- In the early 1990s, Denver International Airport (DIA) planned a fully automated baggage handling system. 
- The goal was to reduce aircraft turnaround time and support the world's largest airport at that time. 
- The project was led by BAE Systems with the City of Denver as the client.

#### Outcome
- The project, originally scheduled for 1993, was delivered 16 months late. 
- Costs exceeded $193 million, with an additional $1.1 million per month in airport delays.
- Eventually, only United Airlines' terminal used the system, and even then performance was poor. 
- The DIA project became a global example of software engineering process failure.

## Analysis
- There are two detailed analyses of the project in the lab folder.
- Review one or both of them

#### Causative Factors
- Make a list of the engineering failures that occurred during the project
- Explain these in the context, where you can, of the ideas we discussed in this section

## Solution
- Your group should present a brief overview how applying software engineering practices could have avoided the project failure.

## Assessment
- There is no right answer 
- Your group will have to convince the class of the validity of your plan
