## Notes for Jonathan

There is no lab for this section
- I rolled into the lab for the next section.

The basic concepts here are repeated in a number of places in the following weeks
- This mod sort of sets the theme
- I find it really helpful to use non-software examples of the concepts 

I would suggest in terms of a formal lab, it could be useful for the groups to come up with real world examples of these principles.

I have also provided a set of readings that are ok with IP to share with students from a selection of sources on design principles.
