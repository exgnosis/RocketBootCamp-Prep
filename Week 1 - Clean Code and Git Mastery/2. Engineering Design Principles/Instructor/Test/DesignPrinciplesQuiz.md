1 What are design principles primarily meant to provide?
1. A measurable set of rules for system design
2. _**Conceptual guidelines for structuring systems**_ 
3. Clean code standards for programming languages
4. Guidelines for structuring and organizing program data
5. Do not know

---

2 A monolithic application is best characterized by
1. Event-driven architecture
2. A single reference database that serves as a single source of truth
3. A system designed originally to run on a mainframes
4. **_A single code base integrated with a single database_**
5. Do not know

---

3 According to Grady Booch, why is industrial-strength software difficult to manage?
1. **_Its size and complexity exceeds human intellectual capacity_**
2. Developers are not skilled enough to understand how to write multiprocessing code
3. It relies on legacy systems that are very difficult to understand
4. It uses obsolete programming languages and concepts
5. Do not know

---

4 What does high coupling typically result in?
1. Highly cohesive components
2. **_Brittle and unstable systems_**
3. Decreased technical debt
4. Isolation of failures
5. Do not know

---

5 High cohesion in software components means:
1. The component is loosely defined
2. Multiple unrelated tasks are grouped together
3. **_All elements of a component focus on a single responsibility_**
4. Components are more difficult to modify
5. Do not know

---

6 Dependency Injection is primarily used to:
1. Eliminate the need for interfaces
2. Force all modules to share one database
3. Improve the cohesion of a module or component
4. **_Implement dependency inversion by providing interfaces dynamically_**
5. Do not know

---

7 The Dependency Inversion Principle states that:
1. High-level modules should depend on low-level modules
2. Low level modules should be implemented before high-level modules
3. Interfaces should be defined after the code is fully written and tested
4. **_Both high-level and low-level modules should depend on abstractions_**
5. Do not know

---

8 In modular systems, what ensures components can evolve independently?
1. A layered architecture
2. Loose coupling between code and data sources
3. **_Interaction between components takes place only through interfaces_**
4. None of the above
5. Do not know

---

9 Suppleness in design refers to:
1. **_Designing flexible interfaces for future expansion_**
2. Avoiding complex database schemas
3. Keeping the amount of code in each module to an absolute minimum 
4. Ensuring components are able to connect to other components to collaborate on tasks
5. Do not know

---

10 Development scaling in software refers to:
1. Designing more features for future releases
2. Increasing the number of programmers on a project
3. **_Increasing the complexity and size of the code base_** 
4. All of the above
5. Do not know
