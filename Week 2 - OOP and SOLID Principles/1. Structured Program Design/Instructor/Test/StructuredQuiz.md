1 Structured programming is most closely associated with:
1. Declarative programming
2. **_Procedural programming_**
3. Functional programming
4. Modular programming
5. Do not know

---

2 Structured programming principles were influenced by:
1. Engineering design patterns
2. Mainframe hardware architecture
3. **_Mathematical models on program structure and computing_**
4. None of the above
5. Do not know

---

3 A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is used to:
1. Documenting decision logic used in the system
2. _**Identify system inputs, outputs, and transformations_**
3. Show the physical channels over which data flows
4. Depicting how the data schema changes during a transformation
5. Do not know

---

4 The technique of breaking down processes into sub-processes within DFDs is called:
1. **_Leveling_**
2. Refinement
3. Modularization
4. Normalization
5. Do not know

---

5 Flowcharts are primarily used to represent:
1. _**Processing logic and decision-making steps**_
2. Hardware architecture
3. Data flows in systems
4. The data dependencies between code modules
5. Do not know

---

6 Alternatives to flowcharts for logic representation include:
1. Decision trees and decision tables
2. UML class diagrams and ER models
3. Gantt charts and PERT charts
4. Normalization and denormalization diagrams
5. Do not know

---

7 A data dictionary defines
1. Application source code variable names
2. _**The structure, fields, and relationships of data records_**
3. A listing of the different names used in a database
4. Rules for allowed use of the data in the application
5. Do not know

---

8 Structured decomposition is primarily a:
1. Bottom-up construction technique
2. Refactoring a block of spaghetti code into subroutines
3. Breaking a module in a loosely coupled interface and implementation
4. **_Top-down system structure design method_**
5. Do not know

---

9 A key goal of structured decomposition is to:
1. **_Simplify understanding and reduce complexity_**
2. Avoid using diagrams
3. Support the development of test cases
4. Reduce coupling among peer modules
5. Do not know

---

10 Structured programming remains important today because:
1. **_All object-oriented code methods internally rely on structured code_**
2. Legacy systems that have to be supported use structured programming
3. Low level assembler code generated by compilers is structured
4. It's not important anymore
5. Do not know
