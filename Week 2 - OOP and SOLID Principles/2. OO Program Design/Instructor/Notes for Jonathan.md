## Notes for Jonathan

Materials
- I have added a number of free resources in the student folder that should be useful

One of the things that I have found over the years is that students do not have a clue about how OO programs are designed
- The ecapsulation/polymorphism tools are assumed to be all that makes up OO.
- That's why I include more of the historical and theoretical material than with other styles of programming that are less opaque 

The lab was tested on the lab VM
