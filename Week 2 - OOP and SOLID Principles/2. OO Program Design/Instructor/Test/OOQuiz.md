2 The OO domain model represents a system as:

2. A _**set of objects the users are familiar with working together_**
3. A set of subsystems with modular interfaces
4. None of the above
5. Do not know

3 Breaking encapsulation means:
1. Reusing methods across multiple classes
2. Hiding internal workings of objects
3. Referencing objects from outside the component they are defined

4 Which relationship best describes inheritance?
1. "Has a" relationship
2. "Uses a" relationship
3. "Part of" relationship

5 An object’s interface defines:
1. _**Messages that can be made and expected results returned_**
2. The boundary between the inherited and non-inherited methods

6 Which of these best describes “transaction objects”?
1. **_Objects created when events that are significant to the domain occur_**
2. Objects that encapsulate transactions from legacy database systems for processing in an OO application
