1 Functional programming is based on:
1. Updating global state
2. Class inheritance hierarchies
3. _**Mathematical functions and immutability**_
4. Rigorously defined algorithms
5. Do not know

---

2 Which of the following is a key principle of functional programming?
1. Variables are mutable
2. Data is processed in place
3. **_Functions avoid side effects_**
4. None of the above
5. Do not know

---

3 Functional programming has recently become mainstream because:
1. It simplifies writing small reusable units of code
2. It replaces structured code in embedded devices
3. New programming languages are all based on functional programming
4. **_It solves streaming big data processing challenges_**
5. Do not know

---

4 Higher-order functions are functions that:
1. Can rewrite themselves on the fly
2. Use first-order propositional loging as code
3. _**Can take other functions as arguments or return functions**_
4. All of the above
5. Do not know

---

5 Instead of iteration with loops, functional programming often uses:
1. Delegation and composition
2. Meta-functions
3. **_Recursion_**
4. Reactive streams
5. Do not know

---

6 In Java, a stream can be created from:
1. **_Arrays, collections, functions, or I/O_**
2. A device that emits regular messages
3. Any Java object that supports multi-treading
4. All of the above
5. Do not know

---

7 In functional programming, a stream is:
1. _**A pipeline of functions applied to data**_
2. A mutable collection of variables
3. Any Java collection
4. A function where the data type of the input and output are the same
5. Do not know

---

8 Which of the following are examples of intermediate methods?
1. reduce, count, collect
2. **_map, filter, distinct, sorted_**
3. anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch
4. orEach, min, max
5. Do not know

---

9 Terminal methods in streams are used to:
1. Flatten nested streams into one
2. **_End the pipeline and produce results (e.g., reduce, collect, count)_**
3. Prevent infinite streams
4. Limit the amount of data generated by the stream
5. Do not know

---

10 In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens because they can:
1. Be executed only once
2. Be assigned higher priority over program constructs
3. Be called directly from other code modules
4. **_Be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, and act as the return value for other functions_**
5. Do not know
