1 What is the main idea behind the Single Responsibility Principle?
1. A class must inherit from only one superclass.
2. A class should implement all related business logic.
3. Automated testing frameworks should be part of each class
4. _**Design guidelines for improving cohesion**_
5. Do not know

---

2 The Open-Closed Principle means that software entities should be:
1. **_Open for extension, closed for modification_**
2. Closed for both extension and modification
3. Closed for modification, open for testing
4. None of the above
5. Do not know

---

3 The Liskov Substitution Principle requires that:
1. Subtypes must extend multiple base types
2. **_Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types_**
3. Subtypes must override all superclass methods
4. Subtypes must hide superclass behavior
5. Do not know

---

4 Which scenario is a violation of Liskov Substitution Principle?
1. **_A subclass overrides a superclass method implementation_** 
2. A subclass implements additional interfaces
3. A subclass method calls the superclass method as part of its implementation
4. A subclass extends abstract methods
5. Do not know

---

5 The Interface Segregation Principle emphasizes:
1. One large interface for all clients
2. Interfaces must never be changed
3. **_Splitting interfaces into smaller, specific ones_**
4. Every class must implement at least interface
5. Do not know

---

6 What is a consequence of violating the Interface Segregation Principle?
1. Interfaces become leaner and focused
2. Lower cohesion for modules relying on the interface
3. Reduced fragility of code
4. **_Clients are exposed to methods they do not use_**
5. Do not know

---

7 Which is an example of a code smell that should be refactored?
1. A method that has no comments to explain the code
2. _**A class with more than 2,000 lines of code and multiple unrelated responsibilities.**_
3. A function that returns references to objects.
4. All of the above.
5. Do not know

---

8 Which benefit comes from applying the Dependency Inversion Principle?
1. Tighter coupling
2. Reduced testability
3. **_Flexible code and easy mocking_**
4. Increased modularization of large components
5. Do not know

---

9 Why is encapsulation important in clean design?
1. It exposes all details for debugging
2. **_It hides internal details and prevents misuse_**
3. It increases cohesion between classes
4. It makes classes dependent on implementation
5. Do not know

---

10 What is the purpose of refactoring in clean design?
1. **_To continuously improve design without changing behavior_**
2. To change behavior while improving performance
3. To rewrite all existing modules
4. To modernize legacy programming styles
5. Do not know
