- 9/13 version 1.o


1 What is a design pattern in software engineering?
1. A reusable software component
2. _**A reusable solution to a common problem in software design**_ 
3. A set of specific techniques for writing Java code in a systematic manner
4. A systematic way to extend the functionality of existing code.
5. Do not know


2 Which of the following best describes the three categories of standard Gang of Four design patterns?
1. Abstract, Concrete, and Composite
2. _**Creational, Structural, and Behavioral**_ 
3. Object-Oriented, Functional, and Procedural
4. Process, Architectural, and Structural
5. Do not know

3 Which of the following is a goal of design patterns?
1. To make code simpler and easier to read
2. To provide a common structural standard for software design
3. **To improve the operational performance of software.** 
4. To develop a standard process for refactoring legacy applications.
5. Do not know

4 Which is an example of a Creational pattern?
1. Adapter
2. Observer
3. _**Factory Method**_ 
4. None of the above
5. Do not know

5 Which statement best describes Structural patterns?
1. They define how to create complex objects efficiently
2. **_They focus on object composition and relationships_**
3. They handle communication between objects
4. They describe how to design the internal structure of a class in an object-oriented language.
5. Do not know

6 Which of the following is a Behavioral pattern?
1. Singleton
2. Proxy
3. **_Strategy_** 
4. Bridge
5. Do not know

7 Why are antipatterns important?
1. Because antipatterns often become the foundation for new design patterns
2. **_Because understanding them helps identify recurring ineffective practices and designs and their remediation._** 
3. Because they are officially documented as risks in secure coding
4. Because they identify which code should be tested more rigorously
5. None of the above

8 Which of these is not a benefit of using design patterns?
1. Standard vocabulary for developers
2. Reduced development time
3. **_Reduction in volume and severity of coding errors_**
4. Improved code maintainability
5. Do not know

9 Which design principle do patterns like Adapter and Facade exemplify?
1. **_Stable interfaces hiding changes in implementation_**
2. Avoid excessive object creation through caching
3. Use inheritance whenever possible
4. Always favor multiple instances for flexibility
5. Do not know

10 What distinguishes a design pattern from an algorithm?
1. A design pattern always produces the most efficient solution
2. A design pattern is language-specific, while an algorithm is language-independent
3. An algorithm focuses on structure, while a design pattern focuses only on syntax 
4. **_An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, while a pattern is a reusable design template for solving a class of problems_**
5. Do not know
