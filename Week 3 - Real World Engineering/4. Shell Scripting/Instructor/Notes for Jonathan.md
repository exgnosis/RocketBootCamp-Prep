## Notes for Jonathan

Materials
- Similar situation to the previous module.

Guide
- The guide document has some topics and associated scripts that can be used to demo and lecture if you don't have your own.
- I have tested all the scripts on a Linux machine and I think I did test on the lab VM a welel

Labs are the same format as the previous module.
