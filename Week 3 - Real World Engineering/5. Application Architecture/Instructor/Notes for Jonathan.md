## Notes for Jonathan

Materials
- The focus is primarily on microservices
- Some of the material on complexity and the 12-factor app is a repeat from previous sections, so this can be skimmed through as a review
- The repeated material is relevant here so skip or review as you see fit.

Lab
- Trying to code a microservice lab may be beyond what can be done
- The lab I am adding is more of a demo
- Since docker is on the lab VM, its basically
  - Two containers, one is a REST application, the other the is a data backing service implementing MongoDB
- I'll set it up in a repo that can just be cloned and run.
